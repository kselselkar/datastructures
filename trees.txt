Binary Search Tree
====================
                Search   Insert  Delete
Sorted Arrays   O(logn)    O(n)   O(n)

LinkedList      O(n)       O(1)   O(1)


But in binary search tree all of them takes O(logn)

Tree Data Structure
=====================
Node -- contains data

Edges -- Connect between edges

Root -- Node at the top of the tree.There can be only one root node. We will be having access only to the root node.

Search -- Can be done only one path.
          For ex...
          A --Root
          |
          C
        |    |
       F  _  G

       In above F & G are connected ,but to search the F node path is A-C-F or A-C-G-F

Any node will have edge running upwards. In above F&G is called childerns of C node.

Leaf node : A node which doesn not children is called Leaf node.

Any node can be considered as sub tree. In our case sub tree is C ,F G

Level : Root of the tree is considered to be at level 0 ,children is considered to be at level 1 and so on

Binary Tree
====================

A binary tree is the one where any node can have atmost only two nodes. Thats why they are called binary tree ,because binary means two.
